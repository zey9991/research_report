## Background

In Pendle V2, a variety of AMM pools are available, allowing traders to swap assets for PT, YT, or vice versa. The swap fee plays a crucial role in shaping the user experience. If the fee is set incorrectly, it can have the following effects:

- **Too High**: This would deter traders from swapping, ultimately reducing the profits of LPs and vePendle voters. Although the fee per transaction may increase, the overall volume of swaps would decrease.
- **Too Low**: This would undermine the profits of LPs and vePendle voters, even though the volume of swaps might increase significantly.

This situation is analogous to a **market competition model** in economics. In such models, a company’s revenue is given by $$R= P \times Q$$, where $$P$$ is the price and $$Q$$ is the quantity sold. If the price is set incorrectly, the revenue will not be optimized, even though the quantity $$Q$$ may fluctuate.

Previously, our team introduced the “Efficient Ratio” as an indicator to measure the effectiveness of fee settings in specific pools. This is similar to the concept of revenue $$R$$ in a market competition model.

In this data-driven report, we aim to explore the following:

- How do different fee tiers affect the “Efficient Ratio”? What is the optimal range according to historical data?
- Has the “Efficient Ratio” functioned well in evaluating the effectiveness of fee settings? If not, is there a more suitable alternative indicator?

## Fee Calculation

In Pendle V2 AMM, there are two types of fees:

- **Explicit Fee**: These are the fees charged according to the specific fee tier of each pool, as displayed in the app. The distribution is as follows:
  - 20% is allocated to LP holders.
  - 80% is distributed to vePENDLE voters.
- **Implicit Fee**: These fees are generated by the formula used to quote the price for each swap. The key characteristics include:
  - The formula is “relatively protective of the AMM pool,” meaning it quotes a conservative price to prevent potential exploitation of the AMM.
  - The larger the trade, the higher the implicit fees.
  - 100% is allocated to the LP holders

In this section, we will provide a detailed explanation of these two types of fees.

### Explicit Fees

In V2, the explicit fees are described in the whitepaper `V2_AMM.pdf` and implemented in the smart contracts `MarketMathCore.sol` (Core Logic) and `PendleMarketV3.sol`.

The whitepaper defines the amount of assets going in, denoted as $$d_{asset}$$  as a function of the amount of PT tokens going out, denoted as $$d_{pt}$$:

$$
d_{asset}=\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}\div or \times feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}
$$
where,

- $$exchangeRate(t)$$ is the spot exchange rate of asset in PT at time $$t$$, , excluding any fees
- $$feeRateRoot=1+feetier$$
- $$yearsToExpiry(t)$$ is the time remaining until expiry, measured in years

Accordingly, the fee can be computed as follows:

- if $$d_{pt}>0$$ i.e. swapping assets for PT, then 

  $$
  d_{asset}=\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}\times feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}
  $$
  The fee is:

  $$
  fee=\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}(feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}-1)
  $$

- if $$d_{pt}<0$$  i.e. swapping PT for assets, then 

  $$
  d_{asset}=\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}\div feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}
  $$
  The fee is:
  
  $$
  fee=-\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}(\frac{1-feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}}{feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}})
  $$
  

This logic is implemented in the `calcTrade` function of `MarketMathCore.sol`. The relevant source code is as follows:

```solidity
function calcTrade(
        MarketState memory market,
        MarketPreCompute memory comp,
        PYIndex index,
        int256 netPtToAccount
    ) internal pure returns (int256 netSyToAccount, int256 netSyFee, int256 netSyToReserve) {
        int256 preFeeExchangeRate = _getExchangeRate(
            market.totalPt,
            comp.totalAsset,
            comp.rateScalar,
            comp.rateAnchor,
            netPtToAccount
        );

        int256 preFeeAssetToAccount = netPtToAccount.divDown(preFeeExchangeRate).neg();
        int256 fee = comp.feeRate;

        if (netPtToAccount > 0) {
            int256 postFeeExchangeRate = preFeeExchangeRate.divDown(fee);
            if (postFeeExchangeRate < PMath.IONE) revert Errors.MarketExchangeRateBelowOne(postFeeExchangeRate);

            fee = preFeeAssetToAccount.mulDown(PMath.IONE - fee);
        } else {
            fee = ((preFeeAssetToAccount * (PMath.IONE - fee)) / fee).neg();
        }

        int256 netAssetToReserve = (fee * market.reserveFeePercent.Int()) / PERCENTAGE_DECIMALS;
        int256 netAssetToAccount = preFeeAssetToAccount - fee;

        netSyToAccount = netAssetToAccount < 0
            ? index.assetToSyUp(netAssetToAccount)
            : index.assetToSy(netAssetToAccount);
        netSyFee = index.assetToSy(fee);
        netSyToReserve = index.assetToSy(netAssetToReserve);
    }
```

where:

1. `fee`  corresponds to $$feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}$$ as described in the whitepaper.
2. `netPtToAccount` corresponds to $$d_{pt}$$ in the whitepaper.
3. A key divergence to note: The whitepaper defines $$d_{asset}=\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}$$ while in the `calcTrade` function, we define $$d_{asset}=-\frac{d_{pt}}{exchangeRate(t)}$$:

```
int256 preFeeAssetToAccount = netPtToAccount.divDown(preFeeExchangeRate).neg();
```

#### Approximation Method for Explicit Fee Calculation

When $$d_{pt}$$ is either above or below zero, the fee computation takes two forms, which can be challenging to implement in a real trading environment. To address this, we propose the following approximation method:
$$
fee=d_{assets}\times fee tier \times yearsToExpiry(t)
$$
 For instance, let’s say Alice wants to swap 1000 USDe → 1100 PT-USDe under the following conditions:

- 6 months before maturity
- AMM Fees: 0.3%
  - We charge 0.3% in APY
- Absolute fees Percentage:   0.3% * 0.5 = 0.15%
- Absolute amount = 1000 * 0.15% = 1.5 USDe

This approximation holds because, as $$feeRateRoot \rightarrow 1$$ (i.e., $$feetier \rightarrow 0$$),  the limits of the following expressions converge to zero:

1. $$lim_{feeRateRoot\rightarrow1}(feeRateRoot-1)\cdot yearsToExpiry(t)=0$$
2. $$lim_{feeRateRoot\rightarrow1}feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}-1=0$$
3. $$lim_{feeRateRoot\rightarrow1}-\frac{1-feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}}{feeRateRoot^{yearsToExpiry(t)}}=0$$
