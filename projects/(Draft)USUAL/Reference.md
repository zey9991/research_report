Hi @Peytonpig nice to connect.

As part of our hiring process for the role, we would like you to look into these two topics and do a sharing on your answers in our next chat:
1. What pools should Pendle support next? For context: aside from the hype and narratives of the underlying pool, we want to maximise “Pool TVL multiplied by implied APY of the pool”. For example, the sUSDE May 2025 pool has a total TVL of 33.5M and Implied APY = 18.33%, hence a “value” of 18.33% * 33.5M = 6.14M
2. Explain the mechanics and quirks of USD0++ as a yield generating asset. If Pendle tokenises it, how should the mechanics for YT-USD0++ work?

You could expect some brain teasers in the session as well, so it would be good if you prepare pen and paper beforehand.

As for the timing, you can schedule the session via this link: https://calendly.com/vu--emsg/interview

USUAL* is a specialized token designed for early investors, contributors, and advisors of the Usual protocol, granting them unique benefits and governance power. It inherits basic functionalities from the USUAL token.
