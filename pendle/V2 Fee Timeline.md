### Tasks and Timeline

Date: 2025-02-11

1. **Preliminary** (Completed: 100%)
   - Fee calculation
   - Pool metrics
   - Data preprocessing
2. **The Most Suitable Efficient Metrics** (Completed: 100%)
   - Candidate metrics
   - Rationale for choosing the metric: Economic or financial meanings
3. **Optimal Fee Tier Range** (Completed: 100%)
   - Three Models
     - Cubic Regression Model
     - Threshold Regression Model
     - Partially Linear Model
4. **Further Exploration** (Progress: 0%, Expected Completion: By 2.19)
   - Robustness analysis: Test the robustness of the model results
   - Heterogeneity analysis:
     1. Investigate how fee tier affects explicit and implicit fees
     2. Explore result differences by grouping based on other features, such as:
        - Similarity of underlying assets
        - Start or expiry dates
   - Introduce additional data sources or metrics
5. **Post-Completion Tasks** (Progress: 0%, Expected Completion: 2.26)
- Regularly update with the latest dataset to check for changes in results
   
-  Monitor whether the optimal fee tier identified in this report has increased the efficiency of the V2 pools in practice.
   
- Consider automating certain processes through programming
